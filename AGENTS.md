# AGENTS.md / Agent Notes

This file is loaded automatically by AI coding agents that follow the AGENTS.md convention
(Claude Code, the Pi coding agent, and others) as project context. It is for AI assistants
working in this repository.

## Sources of Truth

The project's conventions live in the public docs at the repo root:

| Doc                                                                        | Covers                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`                                                                | Project overview, install, package list                                               |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`                                                          | Quality gate, commit format, testing philosophy, **adding a new extension**           |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` → [Branch Protection](CONTRIBUTING.md#branch-protection) | The `main` branch ruleset, required checks, Code Owners, and the maintainer bypass    |
| `VERSIONING.md`                                                            | Semver policy, first-release-is-1.0.0 rationale, release flow, npm Trusted Publishing |
| `TEMPLATE.md`                                                              | Step-by-step guide for creating a new package from `packages/_template/`              |

Read those (especially `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `TEMPLATE.md`) before making non-trivial changes.

## Architecture in One Paragraph

This is an npm workspaces monorepo of Pi coding agent extensions. Each subdirectory of
`packages/` (other than `_template/`) is a publishable npm package tagged with the
`pi-package` keyword so it appears on https://pi.dev/packages. Extensions are TypeScript
modules loaded by Pi via [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti) — there is no compile step
for shipping. Releases are driven by Release Please (`release-type: "node"`,
`separate-pull-requests: true`) with each package versioned independently and published to
npm via OIDC Trusted Publishing.

## Conventions You Must Follow

- Node `>= 22.0.0`. CI tests on Node 22 and Node 24; the release pipeline (and `.nvmrc`)
  is pinned to Node 24, which ships npm 11+ — required for npm Trusted Publishing.
  Node 20 is no longer supported.
- Conventional Commits, scoped to the package directory name when relevant
  (e.g. `feat(tavily-search): add result truncation flag`). Use `chore(<scope>):` for
  changes that should _not_ appear in the package's CHANGELOG (e.g. scaffolding,
  internal refactors that don't affect users).
- All work must pass `npm run check` (lint, format, typecheck, test, version validation,
  security audit + secretlint).
- **No mocking external APIs in tests.** Smoke tests that load the extension and verify
  registration are the preferred shape.
- Each package's `package.json` must include: `keywords: ["pi-package"]`, a `pi` manifest
  with `extensions`, `license: "MIT"`, `author: "Jeremy Combs"`, `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"`,
  and an `image` URL for the gallery card.

## When Adding a New Extension

Follow `TEMPLATE.md`. The full flow (including the one-time npm Trusted Publisher setup
that must happen before the first release) is in `CONTRIBUTING.md` → "Adding a New Extension".

## Branch Protection (operational rules for agents)

The `main` branch is protected by a GitHub Repository Ruleset named **Protect main**.
The full rule list lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md` → Branch Protection; agents working in
this repo must follow these operational rules:

- **Always work on a feature branch and open a PR**, even though the maintainer has
  admin bypass. CI only runs on pull requests, so direct pushes to `main` skip the
  quality gate — agents must not rely on that bypass.
- **All three required checks must be green** before handing back: `Quality Gate (Node 22)`,
  `Quality Gate (Node 24)`, and `Commit Messages`. If a change you make would fail any of
  them, fix it before declaring the task done.
- **Conventional Commits are enforced** by the `Commit Messages` check (commitlint). Use
  `chore(<scope>):` for changes that should not appear in a package CHANGELOG.
- **Code Owner review is required.** `.github/CODEOWNERS` lists `@jmcombs` as the sole
  owner. Do not add or remove entries without explicit maintainer instruction.
- **Do not propose disabling, weakening, or adding bypass actors to the ruleset.** Route
  any such suggestion to the maintainer instead of editing files to work around it.
- **Release Please PRs** (authored by `github-actions[bot]`) are merged manually by the
  maintainer; do not attempt to merge or auto-approve them.

## Files You Should Not Edit Without Discussion

- `release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json` — only edit when adding
  a new package or fixing a clear bug. Do not retroactively edit version numbers; let
  Release Please own them after the first release.
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` — is now fully automated via a dynamic matrix; only the configuration files (`release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json`) require updates.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the job names (`Quality Gate (Node 22)`, `Quality Gate
(Node 24)`, `Commit Messages`) are referenced by the **Protect main** ruleset as required
  status checks. Renaming or removing a job (or changing the matrix versions) will silently
  break branch protection.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — backs the ruleset's "Require review from Code Owners" rule.
  Editing it changes who can approve outside-contributor PRs.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm ci                  # install
npm run check           # full quality gate
npm run lint            # Biome: lint + format + import-sort check
npm run format          # Biome format (write)
npm run test            # Vitest
npm run check:versions  # validate per-package conventions
```
